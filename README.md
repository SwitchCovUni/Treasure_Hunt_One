# Treasure_Hunt_One
This is a virtual robot program written by SwitchCovUni. The objective of the program is to display two virtual robots navigating a computer generated maze. The idea is that there are a bunch of treasures for the robots to find and each treasure has a different number of points. When the robot meets one of the treasures the system will display information associated with the treasure and the robot will gain points. The robot with the most points will win!

The project is split into multiple parts one part of the program is purely for generating the maps and the other is the main program. Unfortunately because the libraries used for each section of the program are vastly different. The map generator will require the user to download a library package called Kivy. Instructions on how to run the map generator are available in the folder labeled 'Map Gen'

How to run the program
-------
For the main part of the program you will need to have python 2.7.9 installed on to your computer. As far as we have tested, the program will work on both 32 bit and 64 bit installs. To run the main program simply open the main.py file on in python. There are no additional libraries required o run the main program. The GUI of the program uses tKinter which is already built into standard python installations. To install python you should visit http://python.org/ and the rest of the process should be self explanatory.

Resources
