How to run the program
-------
First you must install the library needed to run the program. This program make use of the kivy library. The link to where you can find the library is here: http://kivy.org/#download . Make sure that you use the python 2.7 version as the python 3.3 version may not be compatible for your operating system. As of now kivy is only available in 32 bit versions for windows, if any 64 bit versions of Kivy are released in the future we cannot promise that the program will run.

After downloading the library if you are running window you will have to extract to the zip file to somewhere preffered. It may be useful for you to store the library on a clash drive so that you do not have to keep re downloading the library on every computer you use.

Once extracted simply drag and drop the main.py file on to the kivy.bat file. Then you should have a running program

If you are using a your own personal computer and wish to make regular contributions to the project there are a more convenient ways of using the library.
